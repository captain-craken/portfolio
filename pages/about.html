				I started <span class="special">coding</span> when I was about <span class="special">11</span>. I remember my first project was a simple “<span class="special">Hello world!</span>” program in <span class="special">Visual BASIC</span>. I
				remember to this day of proud of me I was for making a computer doing <span class="special">stuff</span>.<br>
				Then i started applyng my so called ""<span class="special">programming skills</span>"" to <span class="special">Minecraft</span> by creating very long costum commands to <span class="special">hack the game</span>.<br>
				From there I started creating more complex programs in all sorts of languages from <span class="special">Javascript to Java, C++ and Python</span>. But I've never found something i liked more than <span class="special">Javascript</span>.
				And that's the <span class="special">story</span> of how I ended up here (<span class="special">kind of</span>).
